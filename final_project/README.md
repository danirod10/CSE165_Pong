# Pong Game

We created a 2 player Pong game using Godot game development engine and their GDNative C++ module.

The game is compatible with Windows, Linux, or OSX



## Compiling

First you need to make sure you have SCons installed:
```
python -m pip install scons
```
You can use SCons to compile the library:

```
scons platform=PLATFORM
```

Where PLATFORM is: `windows`, `linux`, or `osx`.

This creates the file `Pong_project.x86_64` 
Which you need to double click to start the game 


## How to play?
```
Player 1(Green) Controls: W(UP), S(Down)
```
```
Player 2(Red Orange) Controls: UP ARROW(UP), DOWN ARROW(Down)
```
